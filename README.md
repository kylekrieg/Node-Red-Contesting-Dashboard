## About

This program is written in Node Red and displays a real time dashboard for ham radio contesting events.  Radio, score and contact UDP broadcast packets are sent from each contesting computer to the Node Red server.  That information is parsed out and displayed in real time for other contesters to follow.  This dashboard is useful in a multi/1, multi/2, multi-multi radio setup.  It allows operators to keep with the contest during the event.  This program is also useful during Field Day where other operators or guests can follow along in the progress.

Currently this dashboard works with N1MM and TR4W.

## Screenshots
