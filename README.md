Node Red Contesting Dashboard
==============

A basic multi screen contesting dasbhoard written in Node Red.  Currently can display stats from N1MM and TR4W contesting software.  DXLog integration is spotty with more testing needed.

## About

This program is written in Node Red and displays a real time dashboard for ham radio contesting events.  Radio, score and contact UDP broadcast packets are sent from each contesting computer to the Node Red server.  That information is parsed out and displayed in real time for other contesters to follow.  This dashboard is useful in a SO1V, SO2R, multi/1, multi/2, multi-multi radio setup.  It allows non-operating operators to keep with the contest during the event without hovering over an operators shoulders.  This dashboard also allows an operator to stream the dashboard to engage an on-line audience.  The program is also useful during Field Day where other operators or guests can follow along in the contest progress.

Currently this dashboard works with N1MM and TR4W with some integration with DXLogger.

## Screenshots
